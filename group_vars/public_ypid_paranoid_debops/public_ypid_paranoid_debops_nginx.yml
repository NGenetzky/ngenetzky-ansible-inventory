# Consider adding your domain to:
# https://hstspreload.appspot.com
nginx_hsts_age: '63072000'

# This will get you 100 % in 3/4 categories at: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest
# and will exclude alot of clients which ypid considers deprecated ;-)
# This is too much for now ;-)
#
# Only support TLSv1.2.
# Most notably, the following clients (and below versions) will not be able to
# connect anymore:
#
# * IE 8-10 / Win 7
# * Android 4.3
# * OpenSSL 0.9.8y
#
# Those systems canâ€™t be operated securely anyway and should be updated :)
# Currently this is a bit too much :)
# nginx_default_tls_protocols: [ 'TLSv1.2' ]

# This would even exclude Android 5.0 and Android 6.0 which is a bit too much :)
# This would be required if you want also 100 % at the Cipher Strength category.
# nginx_default_ssl_ciphers: 'bettercrypto_org__set_a'

## Refer to https://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-core/docs/guides.html#global-unsafe-writes.
## Ideally only enable this for VMs where it is needed e. g. TemplateBasedVMs.
## This is what ypid is doing so the setting is left at its default at this inventory level:
# core__unsafe_writes: True

core__admin_users: 'user'

## It is expected that this is run against a TemplateVM.
## By default /usr/local is a symlink to /rw/usrlocal/
## This change ensures that the role makes its changes to a path which is
## shared with all AppVMs so that improvements/fixes can be used by all AppVMs.
## The custom /usr/local.template is used to achieve this because /usr/local.orig is copied to /usr/local/ on first boot of a TemplateBasedVM.
